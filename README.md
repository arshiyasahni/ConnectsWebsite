### Project Description

#### Introduction:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Career Services Platform aims to provide a comprehensive online system that connects job-seeking candidates (students) with employers, facilitating efficient job hunting and recruitment processes. The platform allows students to create and update their profiles, upload portfolios, and apply for job offers tailored to their skills and interests. Employers, on the other hand, can post job offers, browse candidate profiles, review applications, and select candidates for interviews. The system incorporates high-security measures to protect user data and ensures a user-friendly experience accessible via PC or mobile devices with internet connectivity.

#### Key Features:

- User Registration and Login:
    * Employers and students can create individual accounts by supplying the necessary information by going to the user registration and login page.
Users who have registered can log in safely using their email address and password.
    * There will be one Admin who will be the super user therefore, will not be requiring a registeration.

- Employer features:
    * Browse Candidates: Based on specific requirements and criteria, employers can search and browse through a database of candidate profiles.
    * Job Offer Management: Employers are able to develop and publish job offers that include thorough job descriptions, eligibility requirements, and instructions for applying.
    * Employers can review and assess applications submitted in response to job offers, shortlist individuals, and get in touch with them for more information.

- Student features:
    * Student profiles can be created by entering personal information, educational information, talents, and experiences.
    * To demonstrate their skills and accomplishments, students can submit their portfolio/resume.
    * Students can look up job postings from employers and filter them according to criteria like geography, industry, or job type.
    * Students can keep track of the status of their employment applications, including whether they have been chosen for further consideration, invited for an interview, or have been turned down by receiving a notification.

- Admin features:
    * Management of User Profiles: The Administrator has the power to create, edit, and delete User Profiles as needed.
    * Management of listings: The administrator is in charge of managing job listings, including their creation, amending, and deletion from the site.
    * Activity Tracking: The administrator has access to capabilities that allow tracking of user activity, such as job applications, interactions with employers, and system usage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students and companies can connect online in a secure environment through the Career Services Platform to facilitate effective job searching and hiring procedures. Students can use the platform to customize their profiles to the needs of the market, and employers can use it to find qualified candidates who meet their needs. The platform streamlines the hiring and job-hunting processes with its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, helping both job seekers and employers in their efforts to further their careers and find top talent.

#### Project Approach and Technology

#### Tools and technologies:
   - Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building enterprise-grade applications. It simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a convention-over-configuration approach and built-in features for dependency injection, data access, and more.
   - React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components based on changes in application state.
   - PostgreSQL: An open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its reliability, scalability, and extensive feature set. It supports a wide range of data types and provides advanced features such as ACID compliance, transactions, and foreign key constraints.
   - IDE (Integrated Development Environment): IDEs offer features like code completion, debugging, and project management tools that can streamline our development process. We are using Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA as per teams preferences. 
   - Package Managers: Node Package Manager (NPM) and Yarn are commonly used package managers for managing front-end dependencies in a React.js project. They allow us to install, update, and manage JavaScript libraries and packages.
   - Build Tools: We are using Maven for our project. It automates the build process, including compilation, packaging, and dependency management.
   - Axios: A JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. Axios simplifies the process of interacting with APIs and fetching data from the backend.
   - Material-UI: CSS framework that provide pre-designed components and styles to enhance the visual appearance and responsiveness of the React.js application.
   - Postman: A popular API testing and development tool. It was used to test and debug your backend APIs during development.
   - Git: A distributed version control system that allows tracking changes to our codebase. It's essential for collaboration, managing code branches, and versioning of the project.
